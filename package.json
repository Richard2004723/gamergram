### The Final Solution: A Clean Push to GitHub

Now that you have a perfect `package.json` file, we need to make sure it gets to GitHub correctly. The following steps will reset your local repository's history and force it to overwrite the broken history on GitHub.

#### Step 1: Delete Your Local Git History

This will remove the old, corrupted repository from your project folder.

1.  Open **Windows File Explorer** and go to `C:\dev\gamergram-main`.
2.  You need to see hidden files. Click the **"View"** tab at the top, and make sure the **"Hidden items"** checkbox is checked.
3.  You will now see a hidden folder named **`.git`**. **Delete this folder.** This completely resets your local repository.


#### Step 2: Create a New, Clean Repository

Now, we'll start fresh from the command line. Run these commands one by one in your terminal (inside the `C:\dev\gamergram-main` folder).

1.  Initialize a new, empty repository:
    ```cmd
    git init
    ```
2.  Set your branch name correctly:
    ```cmd
    git branch -M main
    ```
3.  Add ALL your project files (including your new `package.json`) to this new repository:
    ```cmd
    git add .
    ```
4.  Create your first commit:
    ```cmd
    git commit -m "Rebuild project with correct configuration"
    ```

#### Step 3: Force Push to GitHub

This is the most important step. It will completely overwrite the broken repository on GitHub with your new, clean one.

1.  Connect to your GitHub repository:
    ```cmd
    git remote add origin https://github.com/Richard2004723/gamergram.git
    ```
    *(If you get an error that `origin already exists`, that's fine, you can ignore it.)*

2.  Now, **force push** your changes. The `-f` flag is what forces the overwrite.
    ```cmd
    git push -f origin main
