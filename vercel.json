### What This File Does

* **`"use": "@vercel/static-build"`**: This tells Vercel, "This is a simple static project. Just run the build command from `package.json` and don't look for any fancy frameworks."
* **`"config": { "distDir": "." }`**: This is the most important part. It tells Vercel, "After the build is done, the final website is located in the root directory (`.`). Don't look for a `public` folder."

### Your Final Steps

1.  **Save** the new `vercel.json` file in your project.
2.  **Add, commit, and push** this new file to your GitHub repository.

```cmd
git add vercel.json
git commit -m "Add Vercel configuration"
git push
